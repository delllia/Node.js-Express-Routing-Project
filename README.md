# NODE.js-Routing-Project

## Informal School of IT - Node.js(Express) Homework

In this project I used the express.Router class to create a router as a module, I loaded a middleware function in it, I defined five routes and then I loaded the router module in the main app.
The route paths in combination with HTTP request method GET define the endpoints at which requests can be made and the method on the response object (res) of type res.json() send a response to the client and terminate the request-response cycle.
 
The codebase uses Javascript ES6 Modules and jQuery.
